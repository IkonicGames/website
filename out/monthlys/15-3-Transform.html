<p>This was my first go at 1GAM and it was mostly successful.  I got a late start(about 2 and a half weeks late), and the quality of the game definitely shows this, but it is still a complete game so I am happy with that.  At least I found some good CC0 music by <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lestatv3/12-05-13-golias">LestatV3</a>.</p>

<h4 id="project-management">Project Management</h4>
<p>This has been something that I have been evolving as I make more and more games, and each time I find a new way to optimize my workflow.  There were three major changes that I made this go around.</p>
<h5 id="-kanbanflow-https-kanbanflow-com-"><a href="https://kanbanflow.com/">KanbanFlow</a></h5>
<p>While I don&#39;t quite have the habits necessary to use religiously yet, I was faithful enough to it to reap huge benefits from it.  Mostly time savings because of focus.</p>
<h5 id="-google-sheets-for-game-balance-https-docs-google-com-spreadsheets-d-1j6kjulo02zjgtee7xwacrcptvqejk9fcwsy379go0ds-edit-usp-sharing-"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j6kjulO02zjgteE7XwacrCpTVQEjk9fCWSy379go0ds/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheets for Game Balance</a></h5>
<p>Using the linked google spreadsheet, I was able to easily visualize the skill curve of the game.  While the equations that I use to actually generate the data are completely arbitrary and not really founded on anything but totally wild random guesses, it speed up my iteration time drastically.  Instead of playing through the game to see if the difficulty was increasing how I hoped, I could simply look at a graph and know that it was most likely behaving the way I wanted.</p>
<p>And speaking of GAPPS, there was a very interesting method of project management that was introduced to me using another <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/30glr6/lessons_random_thoughts_after_a_year_of_fulltime/cpt0ptp">google spreadsheet</a>.  I&#39;ll likely give this a try next month.</p>
<h5 id="-code-base-https-github-com-ikonicgames-15-3-transform-"><a href="https://github.com/IkonicGames/15-3-Transform">Code Base</a></h5>
<p>My code base is something that I am actually quite proud of this go around.  Even though I was rushing ot finish most of this, I was able to keep the structure of my project clean and easy to manage.  There are still some hackish solutions, and quite a few incomplete ones, but if I had to come back to this project in a year, I think I could pick it back up pretty quickly.</p>
<h2 id="what-went-wrong-">What went wrong?</h2>
<hr>
<h4 id="scope">Scope</h4>
<p>One of my most common, and I believe this probably applies to most devs, is that I have a habit of thinking I can do more than I actually can.  It is the main reason I have so many unfinished projects.  In the future I am going to do my best to minimize my scope to something closer to that in my first week and a half of my weekly challenge games.</p>
<h4 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h4>
<p>Frankly, this game isn&#39;t very fun.  While I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that it sucks, it is certainly lacking.  The depth is very shallow, there is a very easy and lame way to never die and there is pretty much no juice to give the player any feedback.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-think-">What do I Think?</h2>
<hr>
<p>This game is worth a play or two at least.  The music is pretty good thanks to some CC0 licensing, and the gameplay has promise, but in the limited time that I had to make it, the scope was simply too large and it just lacks too much to be considered anywhere close to good.</p>
